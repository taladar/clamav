Template: clamav-daemon/debconf
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Handle the configuration file automatically?
 Some options must be configured for clamav-daemon.
 .
 The ClamAV suite won't work if it isn't configured. If you do not
 configure it automatically, you'll have to configure
 /etc/clamav/clamd.conf manually or run 'dpkg-reconfigure clamav-daemon'
 later. In any case, manual changes in /etc/clamav/clamd.conf will
 be respected.

 If you choose TCP, clamd can be accessed remotely. If you choose local
 UNIX sockets, clamd can be accessed through a file. Local UNIX sockets
 are recommended for security reasons.

Template: clamav-daemon/DisableCertCheck
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to completely turn off authenticode verification?
 Certain PE files contain an authenticode signature. By default the signature
 chain in the PE file is checked against a database of trusted and
 revoked certificates if the file being scanned is marked as a virus.
 If any certificate in the chain validates against any trusted root, but
 does not match any revoked certificate, the file is marked as whitelisted.
 If the file does match a revoked certificate, the file is marked as virus.

Template: clamav-daemon/ScanSWF

 If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
 without decoding and additional processing.

Template: clamav-daemon/SelfCheck
Type: string
Default: 3600

 database. It also tries to repair problems caused by bugs in the daemon,
 (that is, in some cases it's able to repair broken data structures).

Template: clamav-daemon/User
Type: string
Default: clamav
_Description: User to run clamav-daemon as:
 It is recommended to run the ClamAV programs as a non-privileged user.

 use clamd for filesystem scans, running as root is probably unavoidable.
 Please see README.Debian in the clamav-base package for details.

 an MTA), then you will need to add clamd to the group for that piece of
 software. Please see README.Debian in the clamav-base package for details.
